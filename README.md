MinecraftPEServerStatus
=======================
This is a simply little Java app to demonstrate how to use "Query" on Minecraft Pocket Edition Servers for information such as number of online players, etc. Please use the IP address for the server and the port number should always be 19132 (the default Pocket Edition Query port I believe).
